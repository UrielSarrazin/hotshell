Hotshell is a command-line application to efficiently recall and share commands.

Commands are inlaid in interactive single keystroke menus :
  
<iframe width="100%" style="height: 240px;" frameBorder="0" src="demos/demo.hs.js.html"></iframe>

Try it on the [simulated demo](demos/demo.hs.js.html).

Menus are defined using a JavaScript configuration DSL :

{% highlight javascript %}{% include demo.hs.js %}{% endhighlight %}
